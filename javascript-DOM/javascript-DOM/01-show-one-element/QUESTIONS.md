> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

Your reply here...

After refreshing the page, the text is hidden again.

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

Your reply here...

No, the link stops working. The code lets me add event listeners.

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)

The addEventListener() method allows you to add event listeners on any HTML DOM object such as HTML elements, the HTML document or the window objec.
